   MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS (FROM SCRATCH)
=========================================

This folder contains Python implementations of popular 
Machine Learning algorithms built completely from scratch. 
Each implementation is beginner-friendly, clean, and well-commented.

-----------------------------------------
ALGORITHMS INCLUDED
-----------------------------------------

Supervised Learning:
- Linear Regression       : linear_regression.py   | Predicts continuous values using the best-fit line.
- Logistic Regression     : logistic_regression.py | Binary classification using sigmoid function.
- Decision Tree           : decision_tree.py      | Splits data based on feature thresholds to make decisions.
- Random Forest           : random_forest.py      | Ensemble of multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
- K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN): knn.py               | Classifies data based on nearest training samples.
- Naive Bayes             : naive_bayes.py       | Probabilistic classifier using Bayes theorem.
- Support Vector Machine  : svm.py               | Separates classes using the optimal hyperplane.

Unsupervised Learning:
- K-Means Clustering      : k_means.py           | Groups data points into K clusters based on similarity.
- Principal Component Analysis(PCA): pca.py      | Reduces dimensionality while retaining maximum variance.

-----------------------------------------
HOW TO RUN
-----------------------------------------
Run any algorithm using Python:

    python algo/<filename>.py

Example:

    python algo/k_means.py

-----------------------------------------
NOTES
